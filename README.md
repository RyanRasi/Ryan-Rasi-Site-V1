# Ryan-Rasi-Site-V1
This was my website for the past few months. It worked well and utilised HTML, CSS and Javascript.
<br>The reason I have uplaoded it and why my website looks different is because I want to upgrade my website and server with newer technlogies such as better JQuery implementation as well as smooth animations.
<br><br>
That's not to say that I didn't learn any new things while creating this one as I have learnt about ways to create parralax scrolling images, implementation of SmoothScroll.js as well as Node.js.
<br><br>
I also learnt about common practicies such as the use of fontAwesome for icon images, the use of favicons as well as the mailto procedure. I also had experience in creating nav/sidebars as well as familiarity with the bootstrap framework.
<br><br>
I knew that I wanted to create a one page website with parralax but I beleieve I can accomplish this better once I get a final vision for how it should look like as once I have completed one version of the site I always start work on another and never appreciate the one which I just made. This is good in the sense that I'm always trying something new in terms of technologies but bad in terms of that I am never really pleased with how the final product looks despite it looking fairly high-end, I always feel like I can do more.
<br><br>
In terms of the future I will try and get a new website up by Summer of 2019 and hopefully incorporate some newer Javascript technologies in it such as React or Vue.js as well as re-install my LAMP stack so that it supports PHP.

<br>However it appears that the background images do not appear but the project ones do so I believe that my script for the parralax scrolling does not work for some reason upon the gitHub import.
<br>
Other problems include the responsive design becoming distorted on mobile despite using viewports and media queries and it is most prominent on Safari, however most of the issues have been fixed but nevertheless the website is just not as good on mobile as it is on a widescreen such as a desktop. This also plays a reason to why I'm designing a new website that will circumvent these issues that I had been having.
