# Ryan-Rasi-Site-V1
This was my website for the past few months. It worked well and utilised HTML, CSS and Javascript.
<br>The reason I have uplaoded it and why my website looks different is because I want to upgrade my website and server with newer technlogies such as better JQuery implementation as well as smooth animations.
<br><br>
That's not to say that I didn't learn any new things while creating this one as I have learnt about ways to create parralax scrolling images, implementation of SmoothScroll.js as well as Node.js.
<br><br>
I also learnt about common practicies such as the use of fontAwesome for icon images, the use of favicons as well as the mailto procedure. I also had experience in creating nav/sidebars as well as familiarity with the bootstrap framework.
<br><br>
I knew that I wanted to create a one page website with parralax but I beleieve I can accomplish this better once I get a final vision for how it should look like as once I have completed one version of the site I always start work on another and never appreciate the one which I just made. This is good in the sense that I'm always trying something new in terms of technologies but bad in terms of that I am never really pleased with how the final product looks despite it looking fairly high-end, I always feel like I can do more.
<br><br>
In terms of the future I will try and get a new website up by Summer of 2019 and hopefully incorporate some newer Javascript technologies in it such as React or Vue.js as well as re-install my LAMP stack so that it supports PHP.
